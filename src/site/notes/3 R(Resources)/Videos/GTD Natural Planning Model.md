# Natural Planning Model
## How to Make a Plan for a Project

- Motivation: This is part of the [[2 A(Areas)/Readings/GTD\|GTD]] (Getting Things Done) Approach. Some of the tasks belongs to "Projects" in GTD, but how to plan for projects is vague, especially how can we divide a project into multiple "next actions".

### Natural Planning Model

- **1 Define Purpose and Principles**
	- Purpose:
		- Why doing this project?
		- Giving your brain a problem to think about
	- Principle: Standard and Values of the project
- **2 Envision Outcome**
	- How people react to it?
	- Reference others' outcomes if you don't know what the outcome is going to be like
- **3 Brainstorm**
	- create ideas freely, don't need to schedule everything
- **4 Organize**
	- Determine milestones, sort them into components, priorities, and sequences
	- Fill in details
- **5 Determine Next Actions**
	- break things down

### Implementation(A MD Template)

```markdown
# Purpose and Principle:

* You cannot know what a project should look like or how to create it if you don't understand WHY you're doing it. This includes both its "purpose" - why this project needs to be produced - and your "principles" - the standards and values you hold that impact how and what you produce. *
- ** Purpose: ** 
- ** Principles: ** 

# Outcome Visioning:

* What will it be like when this project is out in the world? It's much easier to see how to do something once it's already done. So, envision your completion of the project so that you know what it might take to get there. *
- ** What the end will ideally look like: ** 
- ** How I will ideally feel afterwards: ** 
- ** How others will ideally respond: ** 
- ** What else will result from the completion of this project: ** 

# Idea Dump:

* Write EVERY idea that occurs to you down so that you don't have to hold any ideas in your head. Do not judge the ideas. Aim for quantity over quality. Resist organization or analysis (also see Getting Things Done, page 73) *


# Next Actions:

I will manage projects and GTD in Notion at the moment

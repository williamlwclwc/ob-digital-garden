## Floating Point Operations Per Second

- In Computing, [FLOPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS) means **floating point operations per second** (**FLOPS**, **flops** or **flop/s**) is a measure of computer performance, useful in fields of scientific computations that require [floating-point]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point "Floating-point") calculations
